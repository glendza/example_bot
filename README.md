# Bot Example

## Setup

After setting up the virtual environment (Python>=3.12.4), run the following command from project root:

```sh
pip install .
```

If you want to run it in development mode (changes applied immediately without reinstall):

```sh
pip install -e .
```

Create and populate the .env file:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

Finally, to run the ChatBot, just run:

```sh
chatbot
```

or:

```sh
python -m chatbot
```
